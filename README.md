# IC.ME | Engineering & Compliance Research Tools

## Organizational Overview
IC.ME provides high-profile data solutions designed for individuals and specialized teams. This repository bridges project information from static storage into dynamic, real-time representations. Following the "Mirror" Model, these tools allow users to see themselves in the data and manage their own predictions through engineered validation points.

## Core Principles
* **Credit-less Logic:** These prototypes are engineered to be used, adapted, and owned by the results they produce.
* **Altruistic Logic:** Systems prioritize safety and accountability. In audio applications, this ensures "Safety" channels remain un-ducked and prioritized.
* **Compliance Insurance:** Manual oversight is replaced with engineered validation, ensuring data sanitization and accuracy.

## Featured Toolsets
1. **Environmental Risk Modeling (NASA Power):** GIS-aligned data ingestion for identifying environmental targets.
2. **Validation through Data Ingestion (Image Processing):** Extracting metadata and spatial information from site documentation.
3. **Audio Matrix & Compliance Bridge:** Automated management of on-site communication using a priority-ducking engine.

## Local Environment Setup
To run the server without the internet, a local Python environment is required.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ic-me-helping/research-examples.git
   cd research-examples

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Configure Local Hardware:**
   Run `python -m sounddevice` to identify your hardware IDs.
   Update the `AGG_DEVICE_NAME` in `Research/Audio_Matrix_engine.py`
